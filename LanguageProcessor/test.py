Beyond guarded gates, inside a glitzy showroom, the US president is on a large TV screen heaping praise on the Chinese company. Its Trumps voice and face, but the recording is, of course, fakea cheeky demonstration of the cutting-edge AI technology iFlytek is developing.\n\nJiang Tao chuckles and leads the way to some other examples of iFlyteks technology. Throughout the tour, Jiang, one of the companys cofounders, uses another remarkable innovation: a hand-held device that converts his words from Mandarin into English almost instantly. At one point he speaks into the machine, and then grins as it translates: I find that my device solves the communication problem.\n\niFlyteks translator shows off AI capabilities that rival those found anywhere in the world. But it also highlights a big hole in Chinas plan, unveiled in 2017, to be the world leader in AI by 2030. The algorithms inside were developed by iFlytek, but the hardwarethe microchips that bring those algorithms to lifewas designed and made elsewhere. While China manufactures most of the worlds electronic gadgets, it has failed, time and again, to master the production of these tiny, impossibly intricate silicon structures. Its dependence on foreign integrated circuits could potentially cripple its AI ambitions.\n\nHowever, AI itself could change all that. New types of chips are being invented to fully exploit advances in AI, by training and running deep neural networks for tasks such as voice recognition and image processing. These chips handle data in a fundamentally different way from the silicon logic circuits that have defined the cutting edge of hardware for decades. It means reinventing microchips for the first time in ages.\n\nA more advanced chip industry will help China realize its dream of becoming a true technology superpower.\n\nChina wont be playing catch-up with these new chips, as it has done with more conventional chips for decades. Instead, its existing strength in AI and its unparalleled access to the quantities of data required to train AI algorithms could give it an edge in designing chips optimized to run them.\n\nChinas chip ambitions have geopolitical implications, too. Advanced chips are key to new weapons systems, better cryptography, and more powerful supercomputers. They are also central to the increasing trade tensions between the US and China. A successful chip industry would make China more economically competitive and independent. To many, in both Washington and Beijing, national strength and security are at stake.\n\nSilicon visions\n\nOn the outskirts of Wuhan, a sprawling city a few days cruise up the Yangtze from Shanghai, stands a factory that would span several football fields. It belongs to Tsinghua Unigroup, a state-backed microchip manufacturer. By the end of 2019, the factory will be producing silicon wafers that will then be cut into advanced memory chips.\n\nTsinghua Unigroup aims to expand the Wuhan facility to three times its current size, at a total cost of $24 billion. Its developing two similar sites, one along the Yangtze in Nanjing and another further west in Chengdu, at similar cost. They will be the largest and most sophisticated chip factories ever built by a Chinese company.\n\nIts all part of an effort by China to drag its chipmaking industry forward. In 2014, the government established the National Integrated Circuits Industry Investment Fund, a subsidy program that plans to raise $180 billion from local-government-backed funds and state-owned enterprises. A year later, it released Made in China 2025, a sweeping blueprint for upgrading Chinas entire manufacturing industry. This set the hugely ambitious goal of producing $305 billion worth of chips per year and meeting 80% of domestic demand for chips by 2030, up from $65 billion and 33%, respectively, in 2016. Today global production stands at $412 billion.\n\nState-backed Tsinghua Unigroup showed off a microscopes view of a chip at a recent high-tech expo in Beijing.

China is the worlds largest and fastest-growing market for semiconductors, but no Chinese chipmaker has broken into the top 15 globally in terms of sales. Advanced chips are primarily made by companies from the US, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Western Europe. Chinas big economic rival, the US, accounts for about half of global sales and half of Chinas chip imports.\n\nBeijing has been trying to build a powerful microchip industry for a long time. Researchers developed Chinas first transistor not long after the device was invented in the US at the end of the 1950s. But the country fell behind as its universities and businesses went through the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution. In the 1960s, as the semiconductor industry began ramping up in Silicon Valley and Moores Law was articulated, Chinas fledgling chip industry lay in ruins.\n\nBy the time the Chinese economy opened up in the 1980s, it was too late. Chipmakers partnered with foreign firms, but the manufacturing equipment they imported became outdated quickly, and they failed to produce even basic chips reliably or in sufficient volume. And even as Chinas electronics manufacturing took off in the 1990s, bureaucratic missteps and the ready availability of high-quality imported chips stymied further government pushes. No Chinese company could match the decades of expertise at foreign firms like Intel, Samsung, and Taiwan Semiconductor.\n\nMark Li, an analyst at Bernstein who tracks the chip industry in Asia, estimates that Chinas most advanced chipmakers are still at least five years behind. Since Moores Law describes a doubling of chip performance every two years or so, thats a sizable gap. China does have numerous low-end fabs making the relatively simple chips used in smart cards, SIM cards, and even basic phones, but not the kinds of factories needed to produce advanced processors.\n\nWhy does China still struggle to make advanced chips when it has become so good at so much else? Basically, because its incredibly hard. The latest chips have billions of transistors, each with features only a few nanometers in size, crafted at the scale of individual atoms. They are so complex that it isnt possible to take one apart and copy its design, as Chinese entrepreneurs have done with many foreign products. And even if it were possible, it wouldnt provide the expertise required to design and fabricate the next generation.\n\nManufacturing involves hundreds, even thousands, of technical challenges, says Yungang Bao, director of the Center for Advanced Computer Systems at the Chinese Academy of Sciences and an expert in microprocessor design. It will take a long time to catch up.\n\nNetwork effects\n\nArtificial intelligence may change the game.\n\nDeep learning is an AI technique that has proved its power in recent years to do useful things like spotting disease in medical images, teaching self-driving cars to stay on the road, and parsing spoken commands. It works in a fundamentally different way from most software.\n\nDeep learning uses large networks that roughly resemble the multiple layers of neurons in a biological brain. As a network learns a task, a cascade of computations occur in successive layers. The results of each computation alter the connections between each layer and the next; essentially, the network reprograms itself as it runs. Its ability to recognize objects in images isnt the result of step-by-step logic operations, as in conventional programming, but gradually emerges as countless parameters inside the network are tweaked and re-tweaked through exhaustive training.\n\nResearchers realized early on that the chips in game consoles, originally designed to be fast at rendering 3D imagery, are better for deep learning than general-purpose chips. And deep-learning algorithms are still mostly trained using scores of these graphics processing units (GPUs). One of the market leaders for GPUs is Nvidia, which built its business supplying hardware for gamers. But now Intel and others have designed powerful new chips for training deep learning. Even cloud software businesses like Googles and Amazons are developing bespoke chips designed for their best algorithms.\n\nSimilar Chinese initiatives have been announced over the past year. In July, search giant Baidu revealed that it is working on a chip called Kunlun for running deep-learning algorithms in its data centers. And in September, the e-commerce powerhouse Alibaba said it would spin out a new company dedicated to making AI chips. Tellingly, the new companys name is Pingtouge, a nickname for the honey badger, an African animal famed for fearlessness and tenacity.\n\nThe timing of the AI boom is fortuitous for Chinas chipmakers. The deep-learning revolution was gaining speed just as the governments latest chip push got under way. AI chip design is still in its early days, and in this technologyunlike memory and logic circuitsthe country is not hopelessly behind.\n\nSpecialized hardware\n\nKai Yu has already played a significant role in Chinas AI revolution. A cheerful, bespectacled man who studied neural networks at college in China and Germany in the late 1990s and early 2000s, he founded Baidus Institute of Deep Learning in 2013, as the company became one of the first to bet heavily on AI.\n\nNavigating Beijings morning traffic in the backseat of a Didi, Yu says the importance of chip hardware quickly became apparent when Baidu started pouring resources into deep learning. In 2015, he says, he suggested that Baidu make a specialized AI chip. But it seemed costly and far outside of the companys expertise. So later that year, Yu left to found his own company, Horizon Robotics.\n\nCambricon, one of the countrys most valuable startups, is selling new chips specially designed for artificial-intelligence cloud applications. Cambricon\n\nHorizon is focused on application-specific microchips that run pre-trained deep-learning algorithms. Its developing them for self-driving cars and smarter robots. But Yu thinks these chips will be everywhere before long. If we look back in 10 years, he says, more than half of the computations on a device will be AI related.\n\nIn August, Huawei, Chinas biggest telecommunications and smartphone company, unveiled a mobile chip, the Kirin 980, that includes a neural processing unita section of logic designed for deep-learning tasks like image and voice recognition.\n\nIn one sense, the chip illustrates a lingering limitation of Chinas capabilitiesit was manufactured by Taiwans TSMC. But in another, it reflects Chinas striking progress and ambition. The chip is one of the countrys first to include features as small as 7 nanometers. Smaller components make chips faster and more capable, but also a lot harder to design and manufacture, so this a significant coup for Huawei. Designs for the part of the chip optimized for deep learning come from a startup called Cambricon, founded in 2016 by researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Today Cambricon is valued at $2.5 billion, making it the industrys most valuable startup. In October, Huawei announced another AI chip, called Ascend, that is designed in-house.\n\nChip on the shoulder\n\nChinas chip ambitions have rattled other countries, especially the US. Partly thats because its efforts to gain access to technology have sometimes involved aggressive acquisitions, forced technology transfer, and, allegedly, industrial espionage. Chipmaking is key to military prowess, and the Obama administration sought to block Chinese attempts to acquire US chip technology long before Donald Trump arrived in the White House. Its one of the few issues that unite US politicians.\n\n\n\nArtificial intelligence is transforming the world.\n\nIn April 2018 the US banned one of Chinas leading tech companies, ZTE, from using US chips because it had broken a ban on selling equipment containing US technology to Iran and North Korea. In October, the US said the memory-chip maker Fujian Jinhau, a company accused of stealing trade secrets, would need a special license to buy US-made components. These restrictions may partly be a response to property theft and unfair trade, but they also look like an effort to slow Chinas chipmaking progress.\n\nYet a trade war may only hasten Chinas ascent. People in China realized that the US can easily stop their progress, says Bao at the Chinese Academy of Sciences. It will probably speed things up.\n\nHowever fast it happens, Chinas march to advanced chipmaking is all but unstoppable. No true superpower can afford to outsource technology that is so critical to both its economic growth and its military security. And after decades of playing catch-up, the country is finally seeing opportunities to establish mastery of the field.\n\nIn Tianjin, Jiang is explaining that iFlytek is thinking about designing its own chips, to improve the performance of its electronic translators. Just then, the AI-generated version of Trump speaks up.  (Rngng zhnng zhngzi gibin shji), he says: Artificial intelligence is transforming the world.'}
